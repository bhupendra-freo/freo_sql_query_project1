        remarks: `The 'id' field serves as a crucial identifier for each user in the system, providing a unique reference point that distinguishes one user from another. This uniqueness is paramount in preventing data collisions, particularly in systems with a large user base. For logged-in users, this ID is typically assigned as a Customer ID, which is a universally unique identifier (UUID) or a similarly structured alphanumeric string up to 36 characters long. The choice of a UUID format allows for the generation of unique identifiers without requiring a central authority to manage ID assignments, significantly reducing the chances of duplication. UUIDs can be generated in various ways, such as using random generation methods or hashing functions, ensuring that each generated ID is distinct from others. This feature is particularly advantageous in distributed systems, where multiple instances of the application may be creating user records simultaneously.
  
        In the case of guest users, the system assigns a 'guest ID' when the 'is_guest' flag is set to true. This guest ID functions similarly to a Customer ID but is typically transient, designed for temporary usage throughout the session. Guest users may interact with the system without creating a permanent account, which allows them to engage with features such as browsing products, adding items to a shopping cart, or making inquiries. However, because these interactions are not tied to a permanent identity, guest IDs are less critical to maintain across sessions. They often exist only as long as the user remains active in the application and may be purged after a certain period of inactivity.
  
        Proper management of this ID is critical, particularly in ensuring that it remains unique across the entire database. Implementing a unique index on the 'id' field can facilitate quick lookups and enhance performance when searching for specific user records. Furthermore, this ID must be immutable; once assigned, it should not be changed under any circumstances, as doing so could lead to inconsistencies in the database and confusion during data retrieval. Careful consideration must also be given to ID generation methods. For instance, UUID version 4 is often recommended due to its random generation approach, which minimizes the risk of collisions even across multiple database systems. However, systems should also be aware of the potential for performance degradation when using excessively long IDs, particularly in high-throughput environments, as longer identifiers can increase storage requirements and impact indexing speeds.
  
        Finally, the ID's role in ensuring data integrity cannot be overstated. A well-defined unique identifier allows for straightforward integration with other tables and systems, providing a reliable means of establishing relationships between users and their associated data. Whether linking to purchase history, user preferences, or activity logs, the 'id' field serves as the backbone of relational integrity in the database, supporting both the operational needs of the application and the analytical requirements of data processing and reporting.`,
